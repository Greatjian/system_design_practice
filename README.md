# System Design Practice

## Intro

Just admit it, you'll find it useful to learn  system design knowledge some time after you start to work full time as a software engineer, no matter if it's for your current work or hopping for a new job.

You might want to ask, what about algorithm questions? Well, they are definitely a must, but I believe you should have gotten pretty familiar with it when you were a CS student learning algorithm at class, or finding internships and new grad positions. I even heard that in some of these interviews you may encounter a simple system design question, although the expectations from the company is lower. You can find my algorithm practice in the [LeetCode Practice](https://github.com/Greatjian/leetcode_practice) repo.

But anyway, my point is that system design is so commonly used in software engineering daily work that you'd better prepare for it as early as possible. And here in this repo I'm going to record my preparations. It helps me to have a deeper understanding of the concepts when I try to take notes from my perspective. Hope it also helps whoever is currently reading this repo.

Now let the journey begins.

## Resources

We are now embraced with the information era. When you search for `system design`, you'll likely to see a considerable amount of learning resources available (and congratulations, the most useful ones are free!). Here I'm going to share my picks after reading several recommendations from other people.

- Grokking the System Design Interview ([link](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview)).

  Good resource for short time preparation. The course covers most of the concepts you'll find in a typical system design interview and has multiple questions being asked in a real interview. The cons is that it's not deep enough based on the current hiring bar, and it's not comprehensive either. This means that the course may only provide you with one possible perspective, while you might be asked to analyze from another one by an interviewer. Overall, this is a good introductory course.

- Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA, [link](https://dataintensive.net/)).

  Using a modern mandarin adjective to describe, this book is YYDS (永远的神). I've already felt the importance of this book before even starting reading it, when seeing countless praises and favorable comments about this book. The legend has it, that after reading it several times, you'll find your internal strength (内功) improve, seeing the world from a higher level, and living with the princess happily ever after... My highest recommendation for this book if you're able to start the preparation early.
